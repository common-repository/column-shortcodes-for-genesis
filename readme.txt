Adds shortcodes to the post editor for all up to date Genesis themes.

== Description ==
This plugin adds shortcodes that create columns, to the post editor to create columns in Genesis-based themes.
The available shortcodes are: 
* [one-half first] and [one-half]
* [one-third first] and [one-third]
* [one-fourth first] and [one-fourth]
* [one-fifth first] and [one-fifth]
* [one-sixth first] and [one-sixth]
* [end-column]

Note that each column must begin with a 'first' shortcode tag, and must end with [end-column].  A failure to use both tags will mess up the layout and possibly the theme.

See [the plugin page](http://desperatelyseekingwp.com/genesis-column-shortcodes/) for use examples.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `column-shortcodes.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Usage ==

In the visual editor, wrap any text or images you'd like in a column, with the shortcodes. Include the square brackets [ ] and do not use spaces.

Note that each column must begin with a 'first' shortcode tag, and must end with [end-column].  A failure to use both tags will mess up the layout and possibly the theme.
